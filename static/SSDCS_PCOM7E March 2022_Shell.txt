create a CLI/ shell that implements the following:
When you enter the command LIST it lists the contents of the current directory
The ADD command will add the following two numbers together and provide the result
The HELP command provides a list of commands available
The EXIT command exits the shell


import os
import subprocess


def execute_commands(command):
    try:
        subprocess.run(command.split())
    except Exception:
        print("psh: command not found: {}".format(command))

def psh_help():
    print("help, list, add, exit")

def psh_list():
    print(os.listdir())

def psh_add(command):
    nums = command.split()
    print("the total of first two numbers :" )
    print(int(nums[1]) + int(nums[2]))
    
    

def main():
    while True:
        command = input("CMD: ")
        if command == "list":
            psh_list()
        if command == "help":
            psh_help()
        elif command.startswith('add'):
            psh_add(command)
        elif command == 'exit':
            break
        else:
            execute_commands(command)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()



What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?
data injection
What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?
data input validation
Add a section to your e-portfolio that provides a (pseudo)code example of
changes you would make to the shell to improve its security?
# Test for only numeric characters   
 nums= command.split()
            try:
                print(int nums[1]) + int nums[2]))
            except:
                print("Only numbers can be added")
